<p>Unnamed namespaces in header files.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>DEPRECATED</b>: Static code analysis checks will no longer be supported in future versions. Use an external tool for static code analysis instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>The typical use of unnamed namespace is to hide module-internal
      names from the outside world. Header files are physically
      concatenated in a single translation unit, which logically
      merges all namespaces with the same name. Unnamed namespaces are
      also merged in this process, which effectively undermines their
      initial purpose.  
</p>

<p>
      Use named namespaces in header files. Unnamed namespaces are
      allowed in implementation files only.</li>
