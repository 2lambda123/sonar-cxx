List of items to do:

- Implement #ifdef #else #endif handling in the preprocessor. The current handling
  is throwing away all preprocessor directives and including all code. While we probably
  wanna analyse both the #ifdef and the #else versions of code, the meld-together
  version isnt always parseable.

- Implement handling of the #include directives in the following way:
  Introduce a Scanner which is called for each #included name. This Scanner doesnt actually
  paste the code in but scans the file for #defines and further #includes. The job is
  to gather all macros. The Scanner keeps track of all files already included and knows also
  of all files which are already parsed.
