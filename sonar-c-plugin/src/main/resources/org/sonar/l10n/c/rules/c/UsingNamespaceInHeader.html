<p>Namespace directive in header files.</p>

<li><b>DEPRECATED</b>: Internal static code analysis checks will no longer be supported in future versions. Plug-in is able to import analysis reports from various external tools. Please consider using external code analyzers instead of deprecated internal ones.</li>

<p>The using namespace directive imports names from the given
      namespace and when used in a header file influences the global
      namespace of all the files that directly or indirectly include
      this header file.</p>

<p>It is imaginable to use the using namespace directive in a
      limited scope in a header file (for example in a template or
      inline function definition), but for the sake of consistency
      this is also discouraged.</p>
