<p>Don't use reserved names.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>DEPRECATED</b>: Static code analysis checks will no longer be supported in future versions. Use an external tool for static code analysis instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>   The C++ Standard reserves some forms of names for language
      implementations. One of the most frequent violations is a
      definition of preprocessor macro that begins with underscore
      followed by a capital letter or containing two consecutive
      underscores.</p>
<p>   Even though the majority of known compilers use more obscure
      names for internal purposes and the above code is not likely to
      cause any significant problems, all such names are formally
      reserved and therefore should not be used.</p>
<p>
      Apart from the use of underscore in macro names, preprocessor
      macros should not be used to redefine language keywords.</p>
